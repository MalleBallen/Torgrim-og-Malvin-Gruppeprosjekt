    "\n",
    "You should bear the following points in mind when working on the project:\n",
    "* Write the name of all persons working in the group at the top of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final project report must start with an abstract, the abstract is a self contained summary of the project and should contain quantitative statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Start your notebook by providing a short introduction in which you outline the nature of the problem(s) to be investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* End your notebook with a brief summary of what you feel you learned from the project (if anything). Also, if you have any general comments or suggestions for what could be improved in future assignments, this is the place to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* All code that you make use of should be present in the notebook, and it should ideally execute without any errors (especially run-time errors). If you are not able to fix everything before the deadline, you should give your best understanding of what is not working, and how you might go about fixing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid duplicating code! If you find yourself copying and pasting a lot of code, it is a strong indication that you should define reuseable functions and/or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you use an algorithm that is not fully described in the assignment text, you should try to explain it in your own words. This also applies if the method is described elsewhere in the course material.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In some cases it may suffice to explain your work via comments in the code itself, but other times you might want to include a more elaborate explanation in terms of, e.g., mathematics and/or pseudocode.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In general, it is a good habit to comment your code (though it can be overdone).\n",
    "\n",
    "* When working with approximate solutions to equations, it is very useful to check your results against known exact (analytical) solutions, should they be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is also a good test of a model implementation to study what happens at known 'edge cases'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any figures you include should be easily understandable. You should label axes appropriately, and depending on the problem, include other legends etc. Also, you should discuss your figures in the main text.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is always good if you can reflect a little bit around *why* you see what you see.\n",
